High-performance KPI and telemetry library for Java, designed for ultra-low-latency and precise metrics. Built on Agrona Counters and HdrHistograms, it supports both real-time monitoring and historical data captures. The library is ideal for systems that require fine-grained performance insights, high-frequency metrics, and minimal runtime overhead. Lightweight and thread-safe, it can be integrated into performance-critical applications such as trading platforms, messaging systems, or any low-latency environment.
